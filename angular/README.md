# Angular News App Demo

This application connects to a localhost publish instance at port 4503 to consume headless content from AEM.

The connection and URL information is baked into article.service.ts, so if you want to change that you should start there.

The easiest way to get started is serve up this app using `ng serve` and open it from your browser via `http://localhost:4200`.

## About Angular version

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.7.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding
