# Headless Adobe Experience Manager â€” Beyond content repository - Lab 724

This is the code and content package associated with Summit 2018 Lab 274.


## Setup

This lab uses AEM 6.4 Beta Load 20. Any release of AEM 6.4 after this should work. The examples use IntelliJ IDE for editing code, however any code editor will do.

To setup the AEM instance with the initial Configurations & Content:

1. Clone this repository
1. From the *start* directory of the cloned workspace, execute:

> mvn clean install -PautoInstallPackage

This will install all referenced code/content needed in the workbook steps.

This lab also uses IntelliJ's embedded Maven build tool. Any maven build system will suffice, the command to execute is:

> mvn clean install -PautoInstallPackage

## Finished State

The *finished* directory contains all of the content and updated Java code created during Workbook activities. If you want to see the outputs, without doing the work, execute this command from the finished directory:

> mvn clean install -PautoInstallPackage,autoInstallContentPackage
