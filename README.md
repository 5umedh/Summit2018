See the README in the code directory for instructions on building the AEM project.

When this lab was delivered at Summit, we did so with the content of the AEM product documentation installed on the lab machines.  Unfortunately, this content cannot be distributed here.  As a result, the content that the lab exercises refer to will not exist on your environment.

We believe that there is still value in distributing these exercises, however, and you should be able to adapt them to work with your own sample content set.
