# L749 - Adobe Target for developers II: Server-side and IoT implementations

### Abstract
Who said marketers get to have all the fun with A/B testing? The power of Adobe Target is not just in the hands of business users. Unlock the full potential of the Adobe Target stack with our server-side delivery APIs and Node JS SDK, and take Target everywhere — isomorphic JavaScript apps, set-top boxes, video game consoles, in-store kiosks, and ATMs — while testing everything. Learn about server-side testing and what sets it apart from a traditional implementation.

In this hands-on lab:
* Implement Adobe Target on an isomorphic server-side React.js application, and integrate it with Adobe Analytics and Adobe Audience Manager
* Discover more than 40 APIs available on Adobe.io, our API gateway, using Postman
* Learn how to leverage Adobe Target in a Javascript backend using our Node.js SDK
* Debugging Target on the server side

This session is for advanced developer audiences.
