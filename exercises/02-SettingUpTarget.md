#Activate Adobe Target via Adobe Launch

## About Adobe Launch
Launch is a platform to develop and deploy Dynamic Tag Management extensions.

Adobe Experience Cloud as well as other third party solutions, requires
code on the customer site in order to activate and integrate them. This may imply extra-knowledge from customer,
or a person from IT department involvement which most of the time doesn't have experience with Adobe products.
As many Solutions customer decides to integrate with as much time and investment it requires.

Here comes Adobe Launch, a project that will make Adobe more open and essential for customers.
Each Adobe Experience Cloud Solution has it's own Adobe Launch Extension.
Multiple Extensions can be combined together into a single bundle.
Once you deploy Launch tag to your site/web applications, you can manage everything via Adobe Launch UI.
