** Why do i get a blank screen**
Click on the bottom left of your screen player to bring up the channel switcher.  Ensure that channels are found & that one of them is selected.

If none are selected, your schedule may not be correct.

If no channels, check the location dashboard to ensure channels are assigned & offline content is updated
